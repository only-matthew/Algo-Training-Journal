There are n+2
 positions numbered from 0
 to n+1
. Initially, position i
 contains an element of weight wi
 for every 1≤i≤n
, while positions 0
 and n+1
 are empty.

You choose an integer k
. Then every element moves exactly once, simultaneously:

If wi<k
, the element at position i
 moves to position i−1
;
If wi>k
, the element at position i
 moves to position i+1
;
If wi=k
, the entire movement process fails immediately.
An integer k
 is perfect if the movement does not fail and, upon completion, every position from 1
 to n
 contains exactly one element.

Determine whether a perfect integer k
 exists.

Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤500
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains one integer n
 (1≤n≤100
).

The second line of each test case contains n
 integers w1,w2,…,wn
 (1≤wi≤109
).

Output
For each test case, print "YES" if a perfect integer k
 exists, and "NO" otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be recognized as positive responses.
